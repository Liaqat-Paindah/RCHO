                    <p>

                        The primary focus of the ARDHO is to reach out to the hard-to-reach population in all provinces
                        of Afghanistan, often under very difficult circumstances, to offer a wide range of services to
                        various marginalized groups in the different sections of society in terms of productive and
                        sustainable livelihood programs, disaster risk management, emergency response and humanitarian
                        assistance. ARDHO works for internally displaced population, poor families, unemployed and
                        uneducated, in need of any sort of emergency and healthcare services.
                        ARDHO aims to tackle the humanitarian crisis including droughts and disaster prevention, develop
                        community basic social services needs and create employment and income generation opportunities
                        for the youth, women, IDPs and poor rural communities to reduce the level of poverty and
                        contribute to the socio-economic development of the communities. Our available team of experts
                        looks at relevant humanitarian needs from various possible angles, analyzes a range of options
                        and recommends the path that would ultimately lead our beneficiaries to desired impacts and
                        sustainable development. We believe in a comprehensive approach that is thorough, proactive,
                        facilitating and result-oriented.
