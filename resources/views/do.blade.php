          <h2>What We Do</h2>
          <p>Influenced by the new development paradigm, which puts people before things, RCHO follows a participatory
            approach in every sphere of its work. The traditional knowledge of the rural poor is valued and respected, and there
            is confidence that rural people are capable of self-reliant organization. On a practical level, the fundamental thrust
            of this approach is decentralization and empowerment.
            For a community to be able to work for its own development and reduce its dependency there is a need for full
            involvement at all stages of the development cycle. The participation of communities in identification, planning,
            management, implementation and evaluation of projects is a key factor in RCHO work. Internally a participatory
            approach is adopted in managing the affairs of RCHO.
            Externally, RCHO role as a “change agent” helps to develop community management structures that are capable of
            managing their own development. This increases the ability of the community to demand accountability in all their
            affairs, from leaders and officials. It reinforces the community’s belief in the value of their own development choices
            and efforts.
            Human resource development is an essential part of our development work. This means ensuring that the community
            is trained and skilled, as well as organized, to maximize the potential of the community to take hold of its own
            development. RCHO strongly believes in maximizing its impact by transferring field experiences into knowledge to
            influence the development policies and practices of NGOs, donors and government agencies. This is important for
            working towards the long-term goal of eradicating poverty.</p>

              <p>Sustainable rural development is a dynamic process posing various needs at different phases of time. These can be
                dealt with continuous interventions based on designed frameworks that incorporate the requirements projected by
                the communities and with the help of the communities by strategizing for public-private partnership.</p>

              <p>During the process of social mobilization, RCHO adopted a participatory, self-help, self-sustainable approach through
                community involvement and formation of volunteer groups in remote rural areas of Afghanistan.</p>
